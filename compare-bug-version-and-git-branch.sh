=== Missing a reference in commit! ===

Gluster commits are made with a reference to a bug or a github issue

Submissions that are enhancements (IOW, not functional
bug fixes, but improvements of any nature to the code) are tracked
using github issues [1].

Submissions that are bug fixes are tracked using Bugzilla [2].

A check on the commit message, reveals that there is no bug or
github issue referenced in the commit message

[1] https://github.com/gluster/glusterfs/issues/new
[2] https://bugzilla.redhat.com/enter_bug.cgi?product=GlusterFS

Please file an github issue or bug and reference the same in the
commit message using the following tags:
For Github issues:
\"Fixes: gluster/glusterfs#n\" OR \"Updates: gluster/glusterfs#n\" OR
\"Fixes: #n\" OR \"Updates: #n\",
For a Bug fix:
\"Fixes: bz#n\" OR \"Updates: bz#n\",
where 'n' is the issue number or a bug id

Please resubmit your patch with reference to get +1 vote from this job
